# Research Assistant RAG System

A personal learning project to build a terminal-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from first principles.

## Learning Goals

- Deep understanding of vector databases (ChromaDB)
- Semantic search with embeddings
- LLM integration and prompt engineering
- Production-ready code practices

## What I'm Building

A system that ingests PDF documents and answers questions about them using RAG with source citations.

## Tech Stack

- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB
- **LLM**: OpenAI API
- **Document Processing**: pypdf
- **Language**: Python

## Progress

- - [x] Week 1 Day 1: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Embeddings & vector databases
  - Deep understanding of transformers and attention mechanisms
  - Production-ready code with error handling and logging
  - Deterministic document IDs using SHA-256 hashing
- [ ] Week 1 Day 2: ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT** - Document processing & chunking
- [ ] Week 1 Day 3: Building retrieval pipeline
- [ ] Week 1 Day 4: Error handling & logging
- [ ] Week 1 Day 5: Integration & testing

## Learning Approach

Following a deliberate learning framework - understanding concepts before implementing, documenting progress in LEARNING_LOG.md
